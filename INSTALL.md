# UNWDS Installation Guide:
This will follow the PocketMine-MP install guide.
## Windows:
+ Follow the instruction from PocketMine-MP [here](https://pmmp.readthedocs.io/en/rtfd/installation.html)
+ Download ["start.cmd"](https://github.com/UnnamedNetwork/UNWDS/blob/stable/start.cmd) and your prefered ["UNWDS.phar"](https://github.com/UnnamedNetwork/UNWDS/releases) from UNWDS repo and replace on it.
+ Start the server!

## Linux/MacOS (use github.dtcg.xyz/UNWDS/installer.sh)
+ Create a directory which you want to install PocketMine-MP into, and cd into it.
+ Then use `curl` to install PocketMine-MP using the following command:
```sh

$ curl -sL https://github.dtcg.xyz/UNWDS/scripts/installer.sh | bash -s -

```
or, if you donâ€™t have `curl`, try `wget`:
```sh

$ wget -q -O - https://github.dtcg.xyz/UNWDS/scripts/installer.sh | bash -s -

```
+ Now, type ./start.sh to run the server!

## Linux/MacOS (manually)
+ Follow the instruction from PocketMine-MP for Linux/MacOS [here](https://pmmp.readthedocs.io/en/rtfd/installation/get-dot-pmmp-dot-io.html)
+ After complete, delete the PocketMine-MP phar file and "start.sh" by:
```sh

$ rm PocketMine-MP.phar

```
and
```sh

$ rm start.sh

```
+ Then, download the UNWDS phar file and startup file by:

## Fix Linux/MacOS permission issues

 ```sh

bash: ./start.sh: Permission denied

```

```

try use these commands:

 ```sh

$ chmod 600 ./start.sh
