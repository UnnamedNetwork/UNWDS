	 * This pile of shit exists because PHP on Windows is broken, and can't handle stream_select() on stdin or pipes
	 * properly - stdin native triggers stream_select() when a key is pressed, causing it to get stuck in fgets()
	 * waiting for a line that might never come (and Windows doesn't support character-based reading either), and
	 * pipes just constantly trigger stream_select() instead of only when data is returned, rendering it useless.
	 *
	 * This results in whichever process reads stdin getting stuck on shutdown, which previously forced us to kill
	 * the entire server process to make it go away.
	 *
	 * To get around this problem, we delegate the responsibility of reading stdin to a subprocess, which we can
	 * then brutally murder when the server shuts down, without killing the entire server process.
	 * Thankfully, stream_select() actually works properly on sockets, so we can use them for inter-process
	 * communication.
